# Will Al Ittihad Win the league

## Project Overview  

This project contains data exclusively for *Al-Ittihad*, focusing on the team's progress in every round.  

- In this project, I managed the full data lifecycle: collecting and processing data after each round, storing it securely in SQL, and implementing automation to streamline the workflow. My main focus was turning this well-prepared data into actionable insights and clear visualizations.  

- The project will be *updated after every  five round*.
   
- The README file will be updated every *ten rounds*.
